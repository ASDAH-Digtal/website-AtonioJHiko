            Chess is a game 
            played between two opponents 
            on opposite sides of a board
            containing 64 squares of alternating colors.
            </p>
            Each player has 16 pieces: 
            <ul>
                <li>1 king</li>
                <li>1 queen</li>
                <li>2 rooks</li>
                <li>2 bishops</li>
                <li>2 knights</li>
                <li>and 8 pawns</li>
            </ul>
            The goal of the game is to checkmate the other king. 
            Checkmate happens when the king is in a position 
            to be captured (in check) and cannot escape from capture.‚Äù

            Chess teaches patience. 
            After a few games, 
            the child learns that 
            making moves without thoroughly 
            looking at the whole board and 
            noticing where important pieces 
            are vulnerable will end up with 
            her losing these important pieces. 
            They will learn that the lack of 
            patience will most likely cause them 
            to end up in checkmate.

            Chess is a great board game for parents 
            to play with their children. 
            The nuances of the game will 
            improve your connection with your child 
            as you teach him or he teaches you how to play effectively. 
            This is a game when you can share and teach strategies, 
            learn from mistakes and be with each other in a quiet, 
            thoughtful way.

            Chess teaches strategy and this creates 
            thinking about two or three moves in advance 
            instead of focusing only on what the next move 
            of your chess piece will be. 
            This changes the usual concentration of 
            only thinking about what is going to happen 
            in the next five seconds. 
            This instructs children to look beyond 
            the first move and the immediate future. 
            This is an enhancement to their planning skills. 
            </p>
            Chess is a healthy distraction from present trauma 
            that children may be experiencing. 
            If their parents are going through a hostile divorce 
            or if they have witnessed extreme violence, 
            concentrating on chess will provide a meaningful 
            respite from the pain that surrounds their life. 
            Chess will teach them that they have a choice 
            of distancing themselves from their agony through 
            healthy means such as chess or 
            unhealthy escapes like drugs and alcohol.
